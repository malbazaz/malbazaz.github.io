The rails project was the most challenging to date.

The most challenging part of the project was to learn how to install and use devise to realize that I didn't want devise because of its complexities and lack of control. I was better off starting from the start without it and be able to design my project the way I wanted to from the very start. After debugging and making devise work for me in my 1st session with the first instructor, the 2nd instructor recommended that I restart the project, which I did. He recommended that I do a new version, to work on a clean project. This is why this project is a v3.

I nonetheless learned to enjoy what rails has to offer. Throughout the module, I often complained about the complexities of rails, and I praised Sinatra. But at the end of this project, although I believe that Sinatra is still easier, I understood why we program in Rails - it has much more to offer. We can do more things and Rails also does try to make things smoother.

The most important lesson was that as projects get more complex, I need to be better organized from the getgo. I need to think out the project fully, whilst in the execution start with a basic app, and then add complex elements to it. Going after the complex elements at the start can complicate things. I learned this the hard way. Instead of having a proper plan, I tackled some complex elements and left some of the easy and essential stuff for later. For example, I tried to tackle nested routes too early. 

My lack of organization in this project also lead me to reconsider my tables, which led me to dropping, migrating to dropping to remigrating to then drop as the original way was correct.

I hope to take those lessons and apply them to my next project.
