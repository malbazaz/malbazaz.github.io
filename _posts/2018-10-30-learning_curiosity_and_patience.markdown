**Learning**

As I tackled my final project, I realized that in terms of what I wanted to achieve in my app, there were a few things that we weren't shown as to how to do exactly. For previous projects, we had covered the materials in such details, that I could create an app brining all the codes together. But here, I was, at the React-Redux and I didn't know everything. This is when I embarked in the journey of programming, the journey of learning. 

For one to be able to code, he/she needs to always be learning. First, you need to keep up to dates with new frameworks, changes in frameworks and changes in languages such as ES6 and ES7. As things improve, languages and frameworks enable us to do more things or things in a better, more efficient, or organized manner. In order to do so, one needs to continuously search online and be in the know of changes. Furthermore, as the language versions update, one needs to be in the know of the differences in versions. In the project I just tackled, I read about ES7 as it helped me resolve an issue with my project through "Await".

**Curiosity**

There is so much out there in the Web that is meant to make our lives as coders easier. These gems/packages/libraries  enable progress and help coders not having to rewrite everything or reinvent the same wheel, so they can build on it. They can borrow other people's work, using it to build something even more awesome. But these hidden treasures needs the coder to always curious. Yes, you need to look for them, go on the web and try to see what's out there and how you can borrow it. Through this project, I learned about both "react-bootstrap" and "boostrap", two different packages I was able to download and install, and together they made my life easier in beautifying my app. Should I had written all the components I used in css, it would have taken me hours of more work, and probably not looked as good.

**Patience**

If there is one thing I learned in Coding and that was re-inforced in my final project, is patience. Debugging needed me to go in the web and read a lot (remember, learn and be curious), and also looking on how people have tackled problems. But it needed most of all that I be patient. Sometimes, it is easy to lose patience. One particular challenge took me days and even my Flatiron Coach couldn't help me with. As he left me without a solution, and no clear direction, I became frustrated and started to lose patience. But I kept working on it, and kept revisiting it. I tried almost everything I knew, and rewrote a couple of functions so many times that I lost track. I also re-wrote the Container Component so many times as well. All this to say, that I had to be patient, go out there and learn and be curious, and eventually as I put all my knowledge (especially the new with the old), I was able to solve it, and I can tell you it was worth it. Keep your cool, and embrace the learning. It's through these challenges that we learn, progress and write better code.

Good Luck with your final project.
