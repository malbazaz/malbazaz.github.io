Why are you taking a coding course when you don't want to become a programmer? Why don't you hire engineers to do that part of the job for you? What was the MBA for, if you're doing a bootcamp after that?

Communication with machines gets more important with every day that passes by. Machines have become part of our every day lives. Most people don't even consider the relevance of programming because they take what is happening behind the hood as given. Yes, in the past it was irrelevant how your television, your car or your telephone worked. But there are 2 main elements that makes it different today: 1. We have shifted from an analog world to a digital one. Yes, even people wear digital watches now 2. Machines enable lifestyle but more importantly business; yes, they dictate how everything works. The implications of these two elements are significant. As the digital world becomes intertwinned with the real world, businesses are not only being disrupted but whole industries are disappearing. Although, this trend has started in the 70s, it is epitomizing now through a second Digital Revolution, where technology is everywhere. The last fully analog businesses (who resisted modernizing thus far) in 2007/8 either went out of business or were forced to rethink their business. Industries have also been disrupted since. The financial markets is one of them, post 2008, everything went digital and even financial institutions look more like technological companies today than a traditional bank.

The digital revolution is undeniable, but its relevance is subdued by skeptics. When I would talk to some people and tell that I plan to take a Coding bootcamp, whilst I didn't particularly want to become a programmer/software engineer, shocked them. Some thought I was wasting time and money, especially after an MBA. Why should programming be reserved for engineers? I couldn't fanthom that. Let me offer you some reasons why I think people should learn how to program. First, I got to enjoy programming. It is mentally stimulating and challenging in ways I didn't know when I signed up for it. So, if you want to intellectually challenge yourself, a coding bootcamp is perfect for you. Second, in the same fashion that today as a General Manager or CEO you need to understanding the basics of accounting, tomorrow (you could also argue: "today") you will need to understand the basics of code. Business foundations are being built through technology and on technology, and code is one of the important pillars. There are other pillars like data, and this should be one of the things to learn on everybody's list, more so than coding. Third, in the modern digital company, the software engineers/programmers have taken the front seat in many aspects, and understanding what they do, being able to communicate with them, being able to help them and build something with them is even more valuable to anyone who aspires to become a manager in some sort in the modern company of today. Yes, I am making the case that Computing is as important for business as Accounting and Marketing, because it enables businesses and defines what is possible and how are things possible. 


As we can see Programming is not only relevant to coders and programmers, but it should be relevant to others, especially business managers. But one could go even further. It is not only a language, some say its a  way of thinking, but I say: it's more than that, it provides you with multiple ways of thinking when tackling a problem. Debugging is a scientific way of approaching a problem, and behind the basis of most startups which is fail fast, and you could also create a case why computer science should become a compulsory subject in all schools.

I hope this is an intro to why you should pick up programming or at least the basics. And if Computer Science is not for you, check out Data science. Because, whenever I'll have time for learning in the future, that's what I would want to be learning next.
